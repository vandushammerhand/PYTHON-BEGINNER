#Dictionaries
#dict={key:"value"} - this is the syntax
#dictionaries always have a key value pair

from tkinter.font import names


purse=dict()
purse['money']=12
purse['candy']=3
purse['tissues']=75
print(purse)
print(purse['candy'])#to select a particular entry from the dictionary

#Dictionaries are like except that they use keys instead of number to look up values

#Dictionary LIterals

#one common use of dictionary is to check the count of something within the dictionary
counts=dict()
names=['csev','cwen','csev','zqian','cwen']#create a list of values from the loop can take values from
for name in names:
    if name not in counts:
        counts[name]=1#the values that were not found in the dictionary is now being iniatialized to value 1
    else:#if the value exists in the dictionary the else statement would be initiated
        counts[name]=counts[name]+1#counting the indexed values that has been initialized
print(counts)


#GET METHOD IN DICTIONARY
#the pattern of checking

#simplified counting with get()
counts=dict()
names=['csev','cwen','csev','zqian','cwen']#create a list of values from the loop can take values from
for name in names:
    counts[name]=counts.get(name,0)+1
print(counts)

#wap to count the number of occurances of each word in a given paragraph
para="A paragraph is a series of related sentences developing a central idea, called the topic. Try to think about paragraphs in terms of thematic unity: a paragraph is a sentence or a group of sentences that supports one central, unified idea. Paragraphs add one idea at a time to your broader argument."

#DEFINITE LOOPS AND DICTIONARIES
#even thoug dictionaries are not stored in order, we can write a for loop that goes through all the entries in a dictionary-actually it goes through all of the keys in the dictionary and looks up the values
counts={'chucks':1,'fred':42,'jan':100}
for key in counts:
    print(key,counts[key])

#retrieving lists of keys and values
jjj={'chucks':1,'fred':42,'jan':100}
print(list(jjj))#prints the a list of all the values in the dictionary
print(jjj.keys())#prints all the keys from the dictionary
print(jjj.values())#prints all the values from the dictionary
print(jjj.items())#prints the all the items from the dictionary

jjj={'chucks':1,'fred':42,'jan':100}
for aaa,bbb in jjj.items():#two iteration variables
    print(aaa,bbb)

#write a program to count the number of words in a text file

#DIFFERENT WAYS TO CREATE A DICTIONARY
dict={}
mydict=dict()
mydict=dict([(1,'apple'),(2,'bell')])#creating a dictionary from the dict() function
print(mydict)

#adding items to the dictionary
mydict={1:'apple',2:'ball',3:'bell'}
mydict[4]='pear'#we are adding one more element into the dictionary
print(mydict)

#update() function in dictionary
mydict={1:'apple',2:'ball',3:'bell'}
mydict.update({4:'pears'})#can be used to add or update values
print(mydict)

#creating a dictionary from the user
dict={}
n=int(input("enter how many values to be read"))
for i in range(n):
    k=input("enter key value:")
    v=input("enter the value:")
    dict[k]=v
print(dict)
